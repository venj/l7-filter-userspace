For bringing this version up to speed with the kernel version and basic sanity:

- Make child connections (FTP, IRC, etc.) work.  This appears to be 
difficult. Can it be handled with iptables rules instead?  Doesn't 
really seem like it.  Can EXPECT in 
libnetfilter_conntrack-0.0.31/include/libnetfilter_conntrack/libnetfilter_conntrack.h
help?

- Catch first packet of UDP "connections".

- Are ^ and $ handled sensibly?  It seems so, yet the testing suite has 
some sort of quirk about newlines.


Things to work on after v1.0:

- Use a more efficient scheme for matching packets with connections.

- Make a mechanism for selecting non-default patterns, such as patterns 
which are faster or more accurate than the default.

- Allow pattern files to specify that l7-filter should use a compiled in 
function for matching instead of a regular expression.


Things to do once there is support for them in the kernel:

- Instead of ACCEPTing all packets, instead be a non-terminating rule.
