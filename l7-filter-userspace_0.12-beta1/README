This is a version of l7-filter that works in userspace instead of the 
kernel.  It is eventually intended to replace the kernel version since 
running in userspace is much safer and more flexible.  However, it is in 
the early stages of development and NOT yet ready for prime time.

Full documentation is at http://l7-filter.sf.net/HOWTO-userspace 
The rest of this file is an extremely abbreviated version of the HOWTO. 
Please refer to the web version for a better guide.  Also see "man 
l7-filter" after installing.

*** Installation ***

- Run "./configure" to check for dependencies.
    You will likely need to install libnetfilter_conntrack and 
    libnetfilter_queue from ftp.netfilter.org
- Run "make".
- Run "sudo make install" or similar.

To choose a different install location use the options on configure.
For instance:

./configure --prefix=/usr

This will install the l7-filter executable in /usr/bin/ rather than
/usr/local/bin

*** Running ***

Make sure you have the ip_conntrack_netlink module loaded or compiled 
into your kernel.  Run l7-filter:

l7-filter -f configfile

See sample-l7-filter.conf for the format of the config file. Send 
traffic to it:

iptables -A FORWARD -j NFQUEUE --queue-num 0

or similar.
