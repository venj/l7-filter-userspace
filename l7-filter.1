.SH NAME
l7-filter \- classifies packets by their application layer data
\fB
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B l7-filter 
-f \fIconfiguration_file\fR [\fIoptions\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
l7-filter reads packets that are queued by Netfilter/iptables and marks them 
based on what application layer protocol they appear to be.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -f \fIconfiguration_file\fR
Mandatory option.  This file consists of pairs of protocol names and mark 
numbers.
.TP
.B -q \fIqueue_number\fR
What queue to read packets from.  Default is 0.
.TP
.B -b \fIbytes\fR
Match on up to this many bytes of application layer data.  The default is
12000.
.TP
.B -n \fIpackets\fR
Examine up to this many packets in each connection.  If no match has been
made after this, l7-filter gives up.  The number of packets counts all packets,
including the TCP handshake and ACK packets (XXX but not any UDP packets that
l7-filter didn't manage to get the conntrack for in time XXX). The default 
is 10.
.TP
.B -p \fIpath\fR
Look for patterns in \fIpath\fR instead of the default /etc/l7-protocols.
The path and its subdirectories are searched, non-recursively 
(subsubdirectories are not searched).
.TP
.B -m \fImask\fR
Use only the bits of the packet mark specified by the given \fImask\fR. 
By default, l7-filter uses the whole 32 bit mark, so this is useful if 
you use other classifiers that set marks. For instance, if you give the 
mask 0xff000000, l7-filter will only use the first 8 bits of the mark 
and will completely ignore the rest of it.  In this case, the mark 
numbers given in the configuration file are mapped onto the mask 
automatically.  So if the configuration file says 2 and you've
given the mask 0x00ff0000, l7-filter will actually use 0x00020000.

The mask must be contiguous (not, for instance, 0x00000f0f) and it must 
be at least 2 bits long.  The number of protocols that l7-filter can 
handle is 2^(mask length)-3 since it uses the value 0 to detect when a 
packet has not been examined yet, 1 to mark packets in connections which 
are unmatched but still being examined, and 2 to mark packets which it 
has given up trying to identify.

.TP
.B -c
l7-filter expects its portion of the packet mark (see -m above) to be
unmodified by other classifiers.  Normally, if it gets a packet whose mark
has already been modified (that is, is non-zero) in this region, it
will send the packet on with the same mark without trying to classify it
and print an error message.  This option causes l7-filter instead to clobber 
the existing mark and classify as if it hadn't been there.
.TP
.B -s
Be silent (don't print anything) except in the case of warnings or errors.
.TP
.B -v
Be verbose.  Gives more information about what l7-filter is doing.  Multiple -v
options increase the verbosity, up to a maximum of 4.
.TP
.B -d
Allow inadvisable configurations.  You must give this option before the option
which is inadvisable.
